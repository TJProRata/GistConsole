    "/primegist && Added \"Preview Widget\" button to the authenticated home page that allows signed-in users (including\n  admins) to test widget configurations without saving them to their account. The preview flow now\n  detects authentication status and sets a \"authenticated_preview\" mode flag that prevents automatic\n  conversion to saved configurations. Demo page shows different CTAs for authenticated users (\"Create\n  Real Configuration\" instead of \"Create Account & Save\") to guide them back to the dashboard for\n  actual widget setup\n\nwe will now be working on refactoring the preview flow to only use local files, not worrying about the actual production widget",
