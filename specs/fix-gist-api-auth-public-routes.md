# Bug: Gist API Routes Failing with 401/500 on Public Women's World Answer Page

## Bug Description

The Women's World answer page at `/womens-world/answers` is a public route that doesn't require authentication, but the new Gist API routes (`/api/gist/citations` and `/api/gist/related-questions`) require Clerk authentication. This causes:

1. **500 Error on Citations**: `/api/gist/citations` returns 500 because it tries to call the Gist API with a `null` userId (since `auth()` returns no userId for unauthenticated requests)
2. **404/401 Error on Related Questions**: `/api/gist/related-questions` returns 401 Unauthorized or 404 because it also requires authentication

**Expected Behavior**: Public answer pages should be able to fetch citations and related questions from the Gist API without requiring user authentication.

**Actual Behavior**: API routes fail with 401 Unauthorized because they require Clerk userId, which is not available on public routes.

## Problem Statement

The Gist API routes (`/api/gist/citations` and `/api/gist/related-questions`) require a Clerk `userId` for authentication, but the Women's World answer page is intentionally public (as specified in `proxy.ts` line 11: `/womens-world(.*)`). When unauthenticated users visit the answer page, the routes return authentication errors instead of fetching data from the Gist API.

The root issue is that these routes check for `userId` and return 401 if not present, but the Gist API itself only requires the `X-User-ID` header for tracking purposes - it doesn't actually authenticate against Clerk.

## Solution Statement

Make the Gist API routes support both authenticated and unauthenticated requests by:

1. **Optional Clerk Authentication**: Check for Clerk `userId` but don't require it
2. **Fallback User ID**: Generate or use a default anonymous user ID when no Clerk user is present
3. **Pass Through to Gist API**: Always attempt to call the Gist API with either the authenticated userId or an anonymous identifier

The Gist API requires `X-User-ID` for analytics and tracking, but it's not used for authorization. We should generate a consistent anonymous identifier (e.g., session-based or device-based) for unauthenticated users.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start dev server: `bun dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/womens-world/answers?q=What%20are%20natural%20ways%20to%20boost%20energy%3F` (without signing in)
3. Wait for streaming to complete
4. Open browser console
5. Observe errors:
   - `Failed to fetch citations: 500`
   - `Failed to fetch related questions: 404` or `401`
6. Check network tab - see `/api/gist/citations` returns 500, `/api/gist/related-questions` returns 401

## Root Cause Analysis

**File**: `app/api/gist/citations/route.ts` (lines 9-13)
```typescript
const { userId } = await auth();
if (!userId) {
  console.error("[CITATIONS-API] Unauthorized request");
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

**File**: `app/api/gist/related-questions/route.ts` (lines 8-12)
```typescript
const { userId } = await auth();
if (!userId) {
  console.error("[RELATED-QUESTIONS-API] Unauthorized request");
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

**Root Cause**: Both routes require a Clerk `userId` and return 401 Unauthorized when it's not present. However:

1. The Women's World answer page (`/womens-world/answers`) is public (line 11 in `proxy.ts`)
2. The Gist API endpoints are also public (line 9 in `proxy.ts`: `/api/gist(.*)`)
3. The Gist API requires `X-User-ID` header but doesn't authenticate it - it's used for analytics/tracking
4. When unauthenticated users visit the public answer page, `auth()` returns `{ userId: null }`
5. The routes immediately return 401 instead of calling the Gist API with an anonymous user ID

No new files needed.

## Step by Step Tasks

IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Update Citations API Route to Support Anonymous Users

- Open `app/api/gist/citations/route.ts`
- Remove the strict authentication check (lines 9-13)
- Implement optional authentication with fallback:
  - Get Clerk `userId` using `await auth()` (may be null)
  - If `userId` exists, use it for the Gist API call
  - If `userId` is null, generate an anonymous identifier: `anonymous-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
  - Pass the userId (authenticated or anonymous) to `fetchCitations()`
- Update logging to indicate whether request is authenticated or anonymous
- Keep all other validation and error handling unchanged

### Step 2: Update Related Questions API Route to Support Anonymous Users

- Open `app/api/gist/related-questions/route.ts`
- Remove the strict authentication check (lines 8-12)
- Implement optional authentication with fallback:
  - Get Clerk `userId` using `await auth()` (may be null)
  - If `userId` exists, use it for the Gist API call
  - If `userId` is null, generate an anonymous identifier: `anonymous-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
  - Pass the userId (authenticated or anonymous) to `fetchRelatedQuestions()`
- Update logging to indicate whether request is authenticated or anonymous
- Keep all other validation and error handling unchanged

### Step 3: Verify Gist API Library Compatibility

- Open `lib/gist-api.ts`
- Review `fetchCitations()` function (lines 157-216)
- Review `fetchRelatedQuestions()` function (lines 360-409)
- Confirm both functions:
  - Accept `userId: string` parameter (any string, not just Clerk IDs)
  - Pass `userId` to Gist API via `X-User-ID` header
  - Do not perform any Clerk-specific validation
- No changes needed if confirmed - these functions already work with any string user ID

### Step 4: Test Anonymous User Flow End-to-End

- Start dev server: `bun dev`
- Open browser in incognito/private mode (to ensure no authentication)
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/womens-world/answers?q=What%20are%20natural%20ways%20to%20boost%20energy%3F`
- Verify loading animation displays
- Verify streaming text appears progressively
- Wait for streaming to complete
- **Critical Check**: Open browser console - should see NO errors about citations or related questions
- Verify real citation sources display in attribution cards (not empty)
- Verify related questions display below answer (not empty)
- Click a citation source card and verify it opens the URL
- Test with different queries to ensure consistent behavior

### Step 5: Test Authenticated User Flow

- Sign in to the app using Clerk authentication
- Navigate to Women's World answer page with a query
- Verify the same functionality works for authenticated users
- Confirm authenticated Clerk userId is used (check server logs)
- Verify no regressions in authenticated experience

### Step 6: Run Validation Commands

- Execute all validation commands listed below
- Fix any TypeScript errors or build issues
- Ensure zero regressions in existing functionality

## Validation Commands

Execute every command to validate the bug is fixed with zero regressions.

- `bun run build` - Build the Next.js app to validate no TypeScript or build errors
- `bun dev` - Start the Next.js dev server
- **Manual Test (Unauthenticated)**:
  - Open incognito browser window
  - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/womens-world/answers?q=What%20are%20natural%20ways%20to%20boost%20energy%3F`
  - Wait for streaming to complete
  - Verify citations load (check attribution cards are populated)
  - Verify related questions load (check questions appear below answer)
  - Check browser console - should have ZERO errors about "Failed to fetch citations" or "Failed to fetch related questions"
  - Check Network tab - `/api/gist/citations` should return 200, `/api/gist/related-questions` should return 200
- **Manual Test (Authenticated)**:
  - Sign in to the app
  - Navigate to Women's World answer page with same query
  - Verify everything works identically to unauthenticated flow
  - Check server logs confirm authenticated userId is used
- **Server Logs Check**:
  - Review server console output
  - Confirm logs show `[CITATIONS-API] Fetching citations` with userId (authenticated or anonymous)
  - Confirm logs show `[RELATED-QUESTIONS-API] Fetching related questions` with userId
  - Confirm Gist API logs show successful API calls with 200 status codes

## Notes

### Why Anonymous User IDs?

The Gist API requires `X-User-ID` header for analytics and tracking purposes, not for authorization. The API doesn't validate the user ID against any authentication system - it simply uses it to:

1. Track usage patterns and analytics
2. Group questions from the same user/session
3. Personalize recommendations based on user history

For public pages, we generate unique anonymous identifiers that serve the same tracking purpose without requiring authentication.

### Alternative Implementation Options

**Option A (Current)**: Generate unique anonymous ID per request
- Pro: Simple implementation
- Con: Each request gets a new ID, losing session continuity

**Option B (Future Enhancement)**: Session-based anonymous ID
- Pro: Maintains user session across multiple queries
- Con: Requires session storage implementation
- Implementation: Store anonymous ID in cookie/localStorage for unauthenticated users

**Option C (Future Enhancement)**: Device fingerprint-based ID
- Pro: Consistent ID across sessions for analytics
- Con: More complex implementation, privacy considerations
- Implementation: Use browser fingerprinting library to generate stable ID

For this bug fix, we're using **Option A** for simplicity. Future enhancements can implement session-based tracking for better analytics.

### Security Considerations

1. **No Authentication Bypass**: The Gist API itself handles authorization via API keys (already in place)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Anonymous requests still go through the same API key, so rate limits apply
3. **Data Privacy**: Anonymous IDs don't expose user information
4. **Public Routes**: These routes are intentionally public per `proxy.ts` configuration

### Testing Edge Cases

Test the following scenarios to ensure robustness:

1. **Rapid Successive Requests**: Submit multiple queries quickly to test anonymous ID generation
2. **Concurrent Users**: Open multiple incognito windows to simulate different anonymous users
3. **Mixed Auth States**: Test transitioning from anonymous to authenticated within same session
4. **Error Recovery**: Test behavior when Gist API is unavailable (should fail gracefully)
5. **Empty Responses**: Test queries that might return no citations or no related questions
